                            <p>I found you at a really weird time just when i was lost kinda and i really felt happy talking to you all this time,<br/> meeting you was prolly
                            one of the best thing that happened to me and i still wonder how was my first text rudeðŸ¤¨ <br/>nevertheless i couldn't have imagined we would become so entangled with each other<br/> i only meant to talk to you as a friend back then but well that didn't go well.lmfao 
                            <br/>
                            Doing this all cause i don't want the goodbye between us to be this sorrowful.<br/> I have lied about few things but it wasn't a lie when i told you that i wanted to be with you<br/> all these time and i still do but let's not go there.
                            <br/>
